# MunchMate

ü•á Built with care @ Cornell AppDev Hackathon ‚Äì a platform to **track meals**, **review foods**, and **split the bill** with friends.

üçΩÔ∏è A feature-rich backend for **restaurant discovery**, **receipt parsing**, and **payment coordination** is fully functional and deployed!

## Application Description

**MunchMate** is a social food tracking application that allows users to:

- Log their favorite meals
- Review and rate food from local restaurants
- Automatically extract itemized data from receipts
- Split the bill and generate Venmo payment links
- Scrape online restaurant menus for rapid onboarding

It‚Äôs your all-in-one hub for food recommendations, receipts, and reviews.

---

## Tech Stack and Tools

- **Flask** ‚Äì Python-based server framework for all API logic.
- **SQLAlchemy** ‚Äì ORM layer for database access and relationships.
- **SQLite** ‚Äì Lightweight, persistent backend database for rapid development.
- **OpenAI API** ‚Äì Used for:
  - Receipt parsing via `gpt-4o`
  - Fuzzy matching restaurant/food names from OCR data
- **BeautifulSoup & Requests** ‚Äì Used in custom web scraper for importing online restaurant menus.
- **Pydantic** ‚Äì Enforces JSON schema structure for parsed receipts.
- **Docker (planned)** ‚Äì Will be used for future containerization and scalable deployment.

---

## System Design Overview

The backend was built with modularity in mind. Here's a high-level overview of the architecture:

- Flask routes are organized by resource (Users, Food, Restaurants, etc.)
- SQLAlchemy models encapsulate all relationship logic
- Third-party APIs (OpenAI) are used in isolation via `convert.py` and `receiptparser.py`
- Tasks like scraping and parsing are cleanly separated for potential async or background handling

---

## Database Schema

We use 3 core models:

- **Users**
- **Foods**
- **Restaurants**

With these join tables to support many-to-many and augmented relationships:

- `favorites_table` ‚Äì Users can favorite many foods
- `user_food_association_table` ‚Äì Users can be linked to foods they‚Äôve eaten
- `user_food_reviews` ‚Äì Stores ratings and textual reviews
- `requests` ‚Äì Tracks Venmo payment requests between users

Each model has a corresponding `.serialize()` method for clean JSON responses.
